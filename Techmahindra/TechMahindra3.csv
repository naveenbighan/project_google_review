athira krishna,Worst company... എംപ്ലോയീസന് വേണ്ട യാതൊരു ഫെസിലിറ്റും നൽകുന്നില്ല.സാലറിക്ക് വേണ്ടിയാണ് വരുന്നതെങ്കിൽ 45 ദിവസത്തെക്ക് അത് പ്രതീക്ഷിക്കുകയേ വേണ്ട.ട്റെയ്നിംഗ് പിരിയടിൻടെ കാശ് പോലും തരില്ല . മലയാളീസ് ആരെങ്കിലും ഉണ്ടെങ്കിൽ ഈ വഴിവരരുത്.,3.7
Venkatesh Kankapurkar,"Worst company... They don't provide any facilities to the employees. If you are coming for salary, you should expect it for 45 days. They don't even give you money for training period. If there are any Malayalis, don't come this way.",3.7
balaji Sontakke,Itni badi company hai to laga tha ki kuchh degree yaha kaam aaegi lekin yaha to kuchh karnelayak hai hi nahi.  Jisne 10th 12th padha hai un logon k liye achha hai yeh company.,3.7
Pritam Paul,This is such a big company that it seemed that a few degrees would be useful here but there is no need to do anything here.  This company is good for those who have completed 10th and 12th.,3.7
